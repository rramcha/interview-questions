#PS-palindrome-search exercise

## Instructions
* Using vanilla JS, create a function that returns an array of all palindromes in order from longest to shortest length. If there no palindromes in the string, return an empty array.
* Provide notes on your code, including how to run it in the Candidate Notes section below.

## Rules
* Palindromes can span multiple words
* Palindrome must be at least 2 characters long

## Example
* Given the string 'civic' or 'c ivic', the following array should be returned:
['civic', 'ivi']

## Candidate Notes

* Copy the javaScript code inside the palindromeSearch.js file
* Go to https://jsbin.com and paste the code in the JS section, you should be able to see output in the console
* Also, params can be changed by passing to the function like for ex:- console.log(palindromeSearch('nayan'));
